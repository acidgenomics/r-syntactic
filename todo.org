** TODO Rename mode needs to be smarter about handling camel case file names.
    Maybe this needs to be a CLI override option.
** TODO Ensure that " - " doesn't process to "minus" in smart mode.
** TODO Improve rename support for file names starting with non a-z0-9 character.
  e.g. add coverage of '[aaa] bbb.txt' file name.
  Currently skipping rename, which isn't desirable.
** TODO syntactic rename needs to handle "'s" to simply "s".
** TODO Add '--dry-run' option to renamer functions.
** TODO Add an option to also rename file extension to lowercase.
** TODO Rename mode: Need to ignore files starting with "~" or "$" (Microsoft Excel).
** TODO `makeNames`: Consider setting `smart = FALSE` by default.
